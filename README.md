# claude-code-setup

A restorable setup for Claude Code (desktop app, Code tab) on Windows + WSL:
global agent instructions, subagents, settings, a knowledge-base skeleton, and
a step-by-step guide to rebuild the environment on a clean machine.

| Instruction file | What it governs |
|---|---|
| `workflow.md` | The four approaches (Easy, Medium, Hard, Autonomous) and their steps |
| `workers.md` | Delegating scoped code tasks to cheap models through Codex workers |
| `language.md` | English for code, docs, specs, commits and instructions |
| `environment.md` | Windows host for routine, WSL for all development |
| `context7.md` | When and how to fetch current library docs |
| `beads.md` | Task tracking for Hard and Autonomous |
| `openspec.md` | Behavior specs in code repos; behavior changes only via Hard |
| `second-brain.md` | Structure and rules of the local knowledge base |
| `secrets.md`, `sensitive-data.md` | Hard rules for credentials and infrastructure details |
| `code-style.md`, `code-design.md` | How code is written and designed |
| `git.md` | Commit format, push gate |
| `writing.md` | Style of READMEs, docs and notes: impersonal, plain, no long dashes |

## Restore on a new machine

Follow [RESTORE.md](RESTORE.md), by hand or by opening Claude desktop in this
folder and saying: *"follow RESTORE.md"*.

## Back up changes

`~/.claude` is the live config; this repo is its versioned snapshot. After
changing anything there:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File .\sync-claude-config.ps1 -Direction ToRepo
git diff
```

Then commit and push.

## Excluded

- Knowledge-base content (notes, areas, session log): personal, local only.
- Claude conversation history, plugin caches, account data.
- Any secret, token, host name or personal identifier. `settings.json` uses the
  `{{HOME}}` placeholder, expanded by the sync script on restore.
